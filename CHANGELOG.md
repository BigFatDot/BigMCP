## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-16

Phase B-1: five production-ready suspending step types built on the
B-0 durable suspension infrastructure. Compositions can now pause
for a human, a clock tick, a child composition, an external HTTP
webhook, or a cross-user approval — all with first-class server-
side validation, UI, REST + MCP surfaces, and audit. The B-1
step-type roadmap is **complete** with this release.

All step types follow the same shape: author declares config on
the step → `validate_config` at promote AND dispatch (catch typos
before they hit production) → `build_suspend` returns a typed
`Suspend(reason=..., payload=..., ttl_seconds=...)` → resume path
validates the response against an author-declared JSON Schema
(server-side authoritative) → `executor.resume(id, body)` injects
the response into the step result. Zero regression on B-0 (Pattern
A composition execution is untouched).

### B-1.0 — `elicit` (human-in-the-loop)

- MCP-native human input via `notifications/elicitation/create`
  for clients that declared the capability; REST `/resume` for
  everyone else.
- Author declares a JSON Schema for the response shape; the same
  schema drives the UI form generator (text / number / boolean /
  enum / required) AND the server-side validation.
- Prompt substitution at SUSPEND time (`${input.X}` /
  `${step_id.path}`) so the user answers the question the author
  wrote with the data values frozen in.
- TTL hard-cap 24h, default 5min.
- Module: `app/orchestration/elicit_step.py`. UI:
  `ElicitForm.tsx` reused by `wait_callback` + `approval`.
- Dependency added: `jsonschema>=4.20.0`.

### B-1.2 — `wait_until` (clock-driven)

- Author specifies `wait_seconds` (relative) OR `resume_at`
  (absolute ISO 8601) — mutually exclusive, 30-day hard cap.
- New `queue_worker.scan_expiry_batch()` runs each tick alongside
  `promote_queued_batch`. For suspended rows past `expires_at`:
  `wait_until` → background-task `executor.resume(id, {"resumed_at":
  <iso>})`; everything else → conditional UPDATE to `expired` +
  audit + timeline event.
- First place the existing `expired` status is actually written —
  B-0 had the column but no path produced it. `elicit`/
  `_test_suspend` rows past TTL now correctly transition.
- Module: `app/orchestration/wait_until_step.py`. UI: blue
  "fires in Xm" badge.

### B-1.3 — `subcomposition` (composes the engine on itself)

- Spawns a child composition execution; the B-0 propagation hook
  (`_propagate_to_parent`) auto-resumes the parent when the child
  reaches a terminal state, injecting the child's result (or an
  error envelope) into the parent's step result.
- Pre-flight depth cap (5) enforced in `create_execution` based on
  the parent's stored depth — caller-supplied `depth=` is
  overridden so a buggy/malicious step handler can't bypass.
- Target validation: same-org + production status only (cross-org
  reports "does not exist" — no info leak; draft targets rejected
  so authors can't point at a mid-edit composition). Self-reference
  rejected at promote.
- Inputs map resolution walks nested dict/list and reuses the
  elicit substitution helper at the leaves.
- Child inherits `user_id` / `organization_id` / `mcp_session_id` /
  `client_capabilities`.
- Module: `app/orchestration/subcomposition_step.py`. UI: purple
  "child running" badge + "View child →" link.

### B-1.5 — `wait_callback` (HMAC-signed external webhook)

- Generates a `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` (~256 bits of entropy)
  per execution per step. Only the SHA-256 hash lands in the DB
  alongside the suspension payload; the plaintext lives in the
  `callback_url` field of the payload so downstream steps can read
  it via `${current_step.callback_url}` and pass it to the external
  system.
- New endpoint `POST /api/v1/compositions/executions/{id}/callback/{token}`
  — **NO JWT** (the token IS the credential).
  Constant-time `hmac.compare_digest`. Uniform 401 for bad token /
  unknown execution / wrong reason (no info leak).
  409 on replay-after-success.
- Optional `expected_schema` validates the inbound body server-side
  via the reused elicit helper; mismatch → 422, row stays suspended.
- TTL hard-cap 24h. `CALLBACK_BASE_URL` env composes the absolute
  URL (falls back to the path for dev/self-hosted).
- Module: `app/orchestration/wait_callback_step.py`. UI: emerald
  "webhook pending" badge + "Copy callback URL" card (flagged as
  a credential).

### B-1.4 — `approval` (cross-user elicitation)

- Two-arm approver gate: `approver_user_ids` (specific users) OR
  `allowed_roles` (Owner/Admin/Member/Viewer) — OR semantics.
- Four-eyes principle by default: the launcher is excluded from
  both arms unless the author opts in with `allow_self_approval:
  true`. Same-org enforcement (`OrganizationMember` lookup).
- Two terminal decisions: `approved` / `rejected`. Both inject
  `{decision, approved_by, approved_at, ...extra_fields}` into
  the step result. `decision` / `approved_by` / `approved_at`
  are **server-set, never spoofable** by the caller.
- New endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/compositions/executions/pending-approvals` —
    filtered queue for the current user; same `can_approve` gate
    that the per-row resume endpoint enforces
  - `POST /api/v1/compositions/executions/{id}/approve` and
    `/reject` — uniform 403 on any permission/state failure (no
    info leak about row existence / state / which gate failed),
    409 on concurrent decision race, 422 on `response_schema`
    mismatch (row stays suspended so the approver can retry)
- 3 new `AuditAction` values: `COMPOSITION_APPROVAL_REQUESTED /
  APPROVED / REJECTED`.
- Module: `app/orchestration/approval_step.py`. UI: pink
  "awaiting approval" badge + Approve / Reject card in the detail
  page (or `ElicitForm`-generated form when `response_schema`
  is declared) + new `/app/compositions/approvals` page listing
  pending approvals.

### Common to all B-1 step types

- `SUSPENDING_STEP_TYPES` extended from `{_test_suspend}` to
  `{_test_suspend, elicit, wait_until, subcomposition,
  wait_callback, approval}`. Static analysis in
  `composition_routing.composition_has_suspending_steps`
  automatically routes any composition with at least one of these
  step types through Pattern C (durable detached execution).
- Each step type wires its `_validate_*_for_production` into all
  3 promote paths (`promote_status`, share-direct admin path,
  `approve_share_request`) so structural issues are caught at
  promote time rather than at first execution.
- Each step type adds its own UI badge in `ExecutionsListPage`
  and a dedicated card in `ExecutionDetailPage`.

### Tests

- **169 new tests across 9 files** covering every step type's
  config validation matrix, permission gates, executor end-to-end,
  and REST endpoint surface. **Zero regression on B-0** (196 +
  169 = 365 tests passed, 10 skipped, 0 failed in CI).
- Full B-0 → B-1 progression from the design doc is now covered.

### Design doc

`mcp-registry/docs/composition_executions_b1.md` (~400 lines)
shipped alongside the implementation; each step type has its
own section with config example + reuse map + test count.

### Misc

- `requirements-lock.txt`: pinned `jsonschema==4.26.0` +
  transitive deps (`jsonschema-specifications`, `referencing`,
  `rpds-py`).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-15

Phase B-0: durable suspension infrastructure for compositions. Adds three new tables and a status-as-lock executor that lets compositions yield, wait for an external event, and resume cleanly across crashes — all exposed via standard MCP 2025-06-18 primitives (`resources/subscribe`, `notifications/resources/updated`). Existing production compositions stay 100% on the legacy sync path (Pattern A) — zero regression.

### Composition execution engine — durable suspension

- **3 new tables** (`composition_execution`, `execution_step_event`, `pending_notification`) via Alembic migration `add_composition_executions`. Down-revision `add_composition_share_request`. No backfill needed (legacy executor was sync).
- **`ResumableExecutor`** singleton (`app/orchestration/resumable_executor.py`) with status-as-lock + conditional UPDATE-RETURNING for concurrency control (no Postgres advisory locks). Idempotence is author-controlled (`step.idempotent=true` opts a step into safe re-run after a crash); the default-safe policy refuses to re-fire a non-idempotent step that crashed mid-flight, surfacing a clear failure reason instead.
- **Pattern A / Pattern C routing** (`app/orchestration/composition_routing.py`): static analysis of the composition's step types decides between the legacy sync executor (Pattern A — zero regression for every existing production composition) and the new detached `ResumableExecutor` (Pattern C — returns `composition://executions/{id}` immediately for clients to subscribe to). Pattern B (progress-streamed) deferred until measured demand.
- **Sub-composition propagation hook**: parent suspended on a `subcomposition` reason gets resumed automatically when the child reaches a terminal state, with the child's result (or error envelope) injected into the parent's suspended step. Depth capped at 5 — enforced pre-flight in `create_execution()` based on the parent's stored depth (caller-supplied `depth=` is overridden, no bypass).
- **Orphan recovery on lifespan startup** marks any `running` row from a prior crashed boot as `failed("backend_restart_orphan")` with a corresponding audit + timeline event before the queue worker accepts new work.
- **Queue worker** (`app/orchestration/queue_worker.py`) singleton: 5s tick, batch limit 200, per-user concurrency cap of 50 — over-quota requests land in `queued` and get promoted FIFO as slots free up.

### MCP surface

- **`composition://executions/{id}` MCP resource** — readable + subscribable, per-user scoped (cross-user reads return the same response as missing rows; no information leak about row existence). Listed in `resources/list` for the calling user; full state via `resources/read`. New `resources/subscribe` and `resources/unsubscribe` handlers track `(session_id → uri)` in process; the executor's terminal/suspended transitions fire `notifications/resources/updated` with parent-chain walk so subscribed ancestors get pinged on child transitions.
- **`composition_status` meta-tool** added to the dynamic pool surface (alongside `search` / `execute` / `describe_tool`) as a polling fallback for clients that can't subscribe. Returns SUMMARY only (status, current step, suspension reason, error, dates) — full state stays behind `resources/read` and the REST endpoint to keep polls cheap. Per-user-scoped: cross-user execution_id returns `status='not_found'`.
- **Pending notification queue + flush on `initialize`**: when the executor fires a transition and the target SSE session isn't live on this process, we persist the `(session_id, uri)` in `pending_notification`. The next `initialize` that comes in with that `Mcp-Session-Id` (gateway now honours the client-supplied header on initialize instead of always minting a new one) triggers a background flush that replays in `created_at` order, deletes on success, and drops rows older than 7 days.
- **Audit emission isolated to its own DB session** (executor `_emit_audit`): the audit_service rolls back on failure, and a shared session would have its ORM identity map expired, breaking the next `execution.composition.steps` lazy-load and silently killing sub-composition propagation.

### REST + UI

- **REST endpoints** at `/api/v1/compositions/executions`:
  - `GET /` — paginated list with `?status=`, `?include_terminal=`, `?limit=`, `?offset=`. Default filter: non-terminal statuses.
  - `GET /{id}` — full detail with state + recent timeline events.
  - `POST /{id}/cancel` — cooperative cancel (202 Accepted, lands at the next step boundary).
  - `POST /{id}/resume` — JWT-only B-0 (B-3 will branch on the Authorization scheme to also accept HMAC webhook tokens). Returns 409 when the row is no longer suspended.
  - `GET /api/v1/compositions/{id}/executions` — admin governance view, all executions of one composition for the org (Admin/Owner only).
- **Web UI** under `/app/compositions/executions`:
  - List page with status chips, include-terminal toggle, per-row cancel button, polls every 5s while ≥1 row is non-terminal.
  - Detail page with status header, parent-execution link for sub-compositions, "Provide test response" form for `_test_suspend` rows (POSTs `/resume`), result/error blocks, full step-event timeline, collapsible raw state.
  - "View executions" link in the existing `CompositionsPage` header so the route is discoverable.

### Schema cleanup

- **`CompositionStep` Pydantic schema** now uses canonical runtime field names (`step_id` / `parameters`) instead of the legacy doc-only `id` / `params` aliases that never matched what the executor reads from the JSONB column. New flags added with safe defaults: `optional`, `idempotent`, `cancellable`, `retry_strategy`, `timeout_seconds`. `extra='forbid'` so authors get a 422 at promotion time instead of a silent runtime mismatch later.
- **`server_bindings`** marked deprecated on `CompositionCreate` and `CompositionUpdate` (field stays on the model — no migration). The executor no longer reads it; tool routing resolves through the user's server pool. Frontend stops sending the empty `{}`. May be repurposed in B-1+ if a real `${binding.X}` use case emerges.

### Quality

- **196 tests passing across 9 new B-0 test files**, zero regression on existing 100+ tests. The 14 must-pass tests from the design doc are all covered; `test_must_pass_b0.py::test_must_pass_tests_exist` freezes the coverage map and fails loud if any test is renamed without updating the map.

### Misc

- **Fixed pre-existing `execution_log` retention bug**: the daily prune loop was failing with `invalid input for query argument $1: 30 (expected str, got int)` under asyncpg because the `(:days || ' days')::interval` pattern needed the bind to be a string. Switched to `make_interval(days => :days)` which takes the int directly.

### Audit log events added

`composition.execution_created`, `composition.execution_started`, `composition.execution_completed`, `composition.execution_failed`, `composition.execution_cancelled`, `composition.execution_expired`, `composition.execution_suspended`, `composition.execution_resumed`.

### Design doc

Full design: `mcp-registry/docs/composition_executions_b0.md` (~1000 lines, two review rounds integrated). Roadmap for B-1+ step types (`elicit`, `wait_callback`, `wait_until`, `approval`, `subcomposition`) follows the same shape — add the type to `SUSPENDING_STEP_TYPES`, add a dispatch branch in `_execute_step`.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-09

Iterative hardening of the v2.1.0 surface, a new Services workspace, MCP 2025-06-18 alignment, remote streamable-HTTP MCP servers, and a session-store rewrite that makes sessions survive backend restarts.

### MCP protocol — 2025-06-18 alignment

- **`MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumped to `2025-06-18`** in `initialize` (was 2025-03-26).
- **`tools/list` items declare `title` + `outputSchema`** (the `search` and `execute` envelopes), and `tools/call` returns `structuredContent` next to the legacy text body so clients can parse the response without regex.
- **`initialize.result.instructions`** describes the search → tools/list → execute flow so clients understand the gateway's two-tool model from the first message.
- **Prompts (`tool_discovery`, `compose_workflow`, `getting_started`, `tool_usage`) rewritten** to reference `search`/`execute` instead of the legacy `orchestrator_*` set.
- **Spec-compliant tool-list invalidation**: `notify_org_tools_changed` now pushes a standard `notifications/tools/list_changed` envelope into every matching SSE session's outbound queue instead of severing the SSE connection. The legacy hard-kill behaviour stays available behind `MCP_KILL_SESSION_ON_TOOLS_CHANGED=true` as an emergency fallback.

### Sessions persisted in Redis (no more stale clients on redeploy)

- **`MCPSessionStore`** replaces the module-level `mcp_sessions` dict. Metadata (user_id, org_id, api_key_id, …) lives in Redis through the existing `CacheBackend` (TTL aligned with `SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`); the per-process `asyncio.Queue` is recreated on demand. Sessions survive backend restarts.
- **Reconnect via `Mcp-Session-Id` header**: the SSE GET endpoint now resumes an existing session if its metadata is still in Redis — clients don't need to re-issue `initialize` after a redeploy.
- **TTL refresh** every keepalive interval keeps long-lived SSE streams warm without flooding Redis.

### OAuth visibility fix (CRITICAL)

- **`Tool.is_visible_to_oauth_clients` is now actually enforced.** The previous filter only honoured `MCPServer.is_visible_to_oauth_clients`, which let the entire catalog (~221 tools) leak to OAuth clients regardless of pool state. Filter now intersects on `(server_uuid, tool_name)` keys against the pool. Without this fix, the dynamic pool from v2.1.0 was effectively a no-op for OAuth clients on the read path.

### Web UI — Services workspace

- **Three-column drag-and-drop UX** (catalog / active pool / toolboxes) built on `@dnd-kit/{core,sortable,utilities}`, with optimistic updates via TanStack Query for instant feedback.
- **Drop a tool on `+ New toolbox`** to create one in place; auto-suffix on duplicate names with a sticky error banner.
- **Edit toolboxes** (rename, recolor, prune items, delete) and **revoke services from chips** (deletes the user credential).
- **AssistantModal becomes a toolbox-by-intent builder** — the LLM proposes a coherent toolbox from a natural-language goal, then the user accepts / regenerates / refines.
- **Mobile tab switcher** for the same workspace at small widths.
- **Full EN/FR translations** for the new UX.

### Pool API surface

- New endpoints to drive the workspace from the web UI:
  - `POST /api/v1/pool/unload` — remove tools from the active pool.
  - `POST /api/v1/pool/suggest` — LLM-assisted tool suggestion for a free-text goal.
  - `POST /api/v1/tool-groups/{id}/load-into-pool` — load an entire toolbox into the active pool in one call.
- All endpoints write to `audit_logs` (POOL_LOAD / POOL_UNLOAD / POOL_TOOLBOX_LOAD).

### Remote streamable-HTTP MCP servers

- **New `remote` install type**: connect to upstream MCP servers exposing a public HTTP endpoint without installing a local process. URL resolved from the marketplace manifest, credentials mapped onto standard auth headers (Bearer, X-API-Key, …) following the same convention as STDIO env injection.
- Schema: new `mcp_servers.url` column, `command` and `install_package` made nullable. Migration `add_remote_install_type` (heals the v2.1.0 chain that referenced this revision).
- Coverage: `tests/test_http_auth_headers.py` validates the credential → header mapping.

### Hardening (post-2.1.0 review backlog)

- Two passes of review hardening on the v2.1.0 batch (defensive org-scoping on bulk updates, error envelope normalisation, rate-limit entries for the LLM-backed propose endpoints).
- `i18n(workspace)`: clarified the wording around server kill-switch vs dynamic pool — they were getting confused in the UI.

### Internals

- New module `mcp-registry/app/services/mcp_session_store.py`.
- 7-test suite for the session store (`test_mcp_session_store.py`).
- Stress-tested live: 50 concurrent OAuth `tools/list` consistent, pool flips propagate after cache invalidation, no cross-org leak, 200 sessions × 20 messages without loss, Redis reattach across simulated process restarts.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-03

### MCP Surface Redesign — `search` + `execute` (BREAKING)

- **Two-tool surface**: OAuth clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, …) now see only **`search`** and **`execute`** instead of the previous 8 `orchestrator_*` meta-tools. Drastically reduces context bloat and aligns with the natural agent loop.
- **Dynamic per-user pool**: `search(query, mode=append|replace, limit=10)` loads tools from the user's full catalog into an active session pool. The pool is materialized via the existing `Tool.is_visible_to_oauth_clients` flag — no new infra, all notifications/cache hooks reused.
- **`execute(goal | tool_name | composition_id [, params])`** with 4-level shortcut routing:
  - L0 explicit (composition_id or tool_name+params) → 0 LLM calls
  - L1 single-entry pool → 0–1 LLM call (param extraction only)
  - L2 clear textual top-1 winner → 1 LLM call
  - L3 ambiguous / multi-step → full IntentAnalyzer + CompositionExecutor
- **Compositions are first-class tools**: production compositions are indexed by `search` and routable through `execute`. Promotion to production now **requires a complete `input_schema`** declaring every `${parameters.X}` referenced in steps (HTTP 422 on mismatch).
- **Audit trail**: every `execute` call writes a fire-and-forget row to the new `execution_log` table (goal, mode, shortcut_level, duration_ms, status, errors). Useful for tuning the L2 thresholds and tracking LLM cost.

### Migration & Rollback

- **Migration `dynamic_pool_default_empty`**: resets every `tools.is_visible_to_oauth_clients` to `false` so users start with an **empty pool**. Users must call `search("…")` once at session start to populate it. Adds a partial index `ix_tools_org_visible_partial` to keep `tools/list` fast.
- **Migration `add_execution_log`**: creates the audit table.
- **Backward-compat shim**: legacy `orchestrator_*` tool names still dispatch correctly (only hidden from `tools/list`). Users who can't update their integrations can re-expose them with `LEGACY_ORCHESTRATOR_TOOLS_VISIBLE=true`.
- **Hard rollback**: set `LEGACY_POOL_BEHAVIOR=true` to revert `tools/list` to the legacy surface (orchestrator_* visible, search/execute hidden) without redeploy.

### Internals

- New module `mcp-registry/app/routers/mcp_gateway/pool/` with `definitions.py`, `pool_loader.py`, `search_handler.py`, `execute_handler.py`.
- Unified `PoolEntry` shape over Tool + Composition for scoring and orchestration.
- Search uses textual scoring (V1); semantic boost via Qdrant embeddings comes in V2.
